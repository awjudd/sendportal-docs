# SMTP

## Sending Emails
SendPortal can also send your campaigns via SMTP. If you select this option, then you will __not__ be able to track your campaigns - for example, deliveries, open and click tracking will not be available.

> For production environments, we recommend using one of the API Email Services instead of SMTP.

To create an SMTP Email Service in SendPortal, navigate to the **Email Services** tab, click the **Add Email Service** button and enter the relevant details, making sure to select **SMTP** as the type.
